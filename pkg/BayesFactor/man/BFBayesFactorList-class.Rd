\title{General S4 class for representing a collection of Bayes factor model
comprisons, each against a different denominator}
\description{
  The \code{BFBayesFactorList} class is a general S4 class
  for representing models model comparison via Bayes
  factor. See the examples for demonstrations of
  BFBayesFactorList methods.
}
\details{
  \describe{ \code{BFBayesFactorList} objects inherit from
  lists, and contain a single slot:

  \item{version}{character string giving the version and
  revision number of the package that the model was created
  in}

  Each element of the list contains a single
  \code{"\link[=BFBayesFactor-class]{BFBayesFactor}"}
  object. Each element of the list must have the same
  numerators, in the same order, as all the others. The
  list object is displayed as a matrix of Bayes factors. }
}
\examples{
## Compute some Bayes factors to demonstrate Bayes factor lists
data(puzzles)
bfs <- anovaBF(RT ~ shape*color + ID, data = puzzles, whichRandom = "ID", progress=FALSE)

## Create a matrix of Bayes factors
bfList <- bfs / bfs
bfList

## Use indexing to select parts of the 'matrix'
bfList[1,]
bfList[,1]

## We can use the t (transpose) function as well, to get back a BFBayesFactor
t(bfList[2,])

## Or transpose the whole matrix
t(bfList)
