##' This function computes Bayes factors for all main-effects and interaction
##' contrasts in an ANOVA design.
##'
##' Models, priors, and methods of computation are provided in Rouder et al.
##' (2012).
##'
##' The ANOVA model for a vector of observations \eqn{y} is \deqn{ y = \mu + X_1
##' \theta_1 + \ldots + X_p\theta_p +\epsilon,} where
##' \eqn{\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_p} are vectors of main-effect and interaction
##' effects, \eqn{X_1,\ldots,X_p} are corresponding design matrices, and
##' \eqn{\epsilon} is a vector of zero-centered noise terms with variance
##' \eqn{\sigma^2}.  Zellner and Siow (1980) inspired g-priors are placed on
##' effects, but with a separate g-prior parameter for each covariate:
##' \deqn{\theta_1~N(0,g_1\sigma^2), \ldots,  \theta_p~N(0,g_p \sigma^2).}  A
##' Jeffries prior is placed on \eqn{\mu} and \eqn{\sigma^2}.  Independent
##' scaled inverse-chi-square priors with one degree of freedom are placed on
##' \eqn{g_1,\ldots,g_p}.  The square-root of the scale for g's corresponding to
##' fixed and random effects is given by \code{rscaleFixed} and
##' \code{rscaleRandom}, respectively.
##'
##' When a factor is treated as random, there are as many main effect terms in
##' the vector \eqn{\theta} as levels.  When a factor is treated as fixed, the
##' sums-to-zero linear constraint is enforced by centering the corresponding
##' design matrix, and there is one fewer main effect terms as levels.  The
##' Cornfield-Tukey model of interactions is assumed.  Details are provided in
##' Rouder et al. (2012)
##'
##' Bayes factors are computed by integrating the likelihood with respect to the
##' priors on parameters.  The integration of all parameters except
##' \eqn{g_1,\ldots,g_p} may be expressed in closed-form; the integration of
##' \eqn{g_1,\ldots,g_p} is performed through Monte Carlo sampling, and
##' \code{iterations} is the number of iterations used to estimate the Bayes
##' factor.
##'
##' \code{anovaBF} computes Bayes factors for either all submodels or select
##' submodels missing a single main effect or covariate, depending on the
##' argument \code{whichModels}. If no random factors are specified, the null
##' model assumed by \code{anovaBF} is the grand-mean only model. If random
##' factors are specified, the null model is the model with an additive model on
##' all random factors, plus a grand mean. Thus, \code{anovaBF} does not
##' currently test random factors. Testing random factors is possible with
##' \code{\link{lmBF}}.
##'
##' The argument \code{whichModels} controls which models are tested. Possible
##' values are 'all', 'withmain', 'top', and 'bottom'. Setting
##' \code{whichModels} to 'all' will test all models that can be created by
##' including or not including a main effect or interaction. 'top' will test all
##' models that can be created by removing or leaving in a main effect or
##' interaction term from the full model. 'bottom' creates models by adding
##' single factors or interactions to the null model. 'withmain' will test all
##' models, with the constraint that if an interaction is included, the
##' corresponding main effects are also included.
##'
##' For the \code{rscaleFixed} and \code{rscaleRandom} arguments, several named
##' values are recognized: "medium", "wide", and "ultrawide", corresponding to
##' \eqn{r} scale values of 1/2, \eqn{\sqrt{2}/2}{sqrt(2)/2}, and 1,
##' respectively. In addition, \code{rscaleRandom} can be set to the "nuisance",
##' which sets \eqn{r=1} (and is thus equivalent to "ultrawide"). The "nuisance"
##' setting is for medium-to-large-sized effects assumed to be in the data but
##' typically not of interest, such as variance due to participants.

##' @note The function \code{anovaBF} will compute Bayes factors for all
##'   possible combinations of fixed factors and interactions, against the null
##'   hypothesis that \emph{all} effects are 0. The total number of tests
##'   computed will be \eqn{2^{2^K - 1}}{2^(2^K - 1)} for \eqn{K} fixed factors.
##'   This number increases very quickly with the number of factors. For
##'   instance, for a five-way ANOVA, the total number of tests exceeds two
##'   billion. Even though each test takes a fraction of a second, the time
##'   taken for all tests could exceed your lifetime. An option is included to
##'   prevent this: \code{options('BFMaxModels')}, which defaults to 50,000, is
##'   the maximum number of models that `anovaBF` will analyze at once. This can
##'   be increased by increasing the option value.
##'
##'   It is possible to reduce the number of models tested by only testing the
##'   most complex model and every restriction that can be formed by removing
##'   one factor or interaction using the \code{whichModels} argument. Setting
##'   this argument to 'top' reduces the number of tests to \eqn{2^K-1}, which
##'   is more manageable. The Bayes factor for each restriction against the most
##'   complex model can be interpreted as a test of the removed
##'   factor/interaction. Setting \code{whichModels} to 'withmain' will not
##'   reduce the number of tests as much as 'top' but the results may be more
##'   interpretable, since an interaction is only allowed when all interacting
##'   effects (main or interaction) are also included in the model.
